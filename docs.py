## ‚ö° Critical Power Analysis ‚Äì How It Works

This tool estimates your **Critical Power (CP)** ‚Äî the highest power you can sustain without fatigue rapidly accumulating ‚Äî based on **running power data** from a `.csv` file exported from Stryd or Garmin.

### üßÆ 1Ô∏è‚É£ Critical Power Models

#### **A. 3/12-Minute Test (Linear Model)**
You perform two all-out efforts:
- **3 minutes** (short, anaerobic effort)
- **12 minutes** (long, aerobic effort)

The tool finds the **highest average power** over those durations and uses the **linear CP model**:

""")
        st.latex(r"P = CP + \frac{W‚Ä≤}{t}")
        st.markdown(r"""
where:
- *P* = mean power (W)  
- *t* = duration (s)  
- *CP* = Critical Power (W)  
- *W‚Ä≤* = finite anaerobic work capacity (J)

From these two data points, both **CP** and **W‚Ä≤** are solved directly.

#### **B. 5 K Time Trial (Empirical Model)**
If you upload a 5 K time trial file, the tool identifies the **highest-power 5 000 m segment** (using the *watch distance* field, not elapsed time).

The 5 K average power is then converted to CP using **empirical fatigue scaling factors**, inspired by Steve Palladino‚Äôs Power Project calculator:

| Runner Type | Typical CP vs 5 K Power | Description |
|--------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **Highly aerobic / ultra runner (slow fatigue)** | ~ 98.5 % | Exceptional endurance; power stays close to race power. |
| **Balanced distance runner (typical)** | ~ 97.5 % | Well-trained athlete; typical 5 K ‚Äì marathon profile. |
| **Anaerobic / sprinter (fast fatigue)** | ~ 96.5 % | Strong short-term power; fatigues faster on long efforts. |

This gives a **CP range** rather than a single value ‚Äî just like Palladino‚Äôs calculator ‚Äî showing realistic variability between athlete types.

### üìä 2Ô∏è‚É£ Segment Selection

- The app automatically finds the **best rolling window** for each test duration (e.g. best 3 min, 12 min, or 5 000 m).  
- If a slightly longer segment yields the same or higher average power, it **extends** the window automatically.  
- Results include actual distance, duration, pace, and mean power.

### üìò 4Ô∏è‚É£ Interpretation

| Metric | What it tells you |
|---------|------------------|
| **Critical Power (CP)** | Sustainable threshold ‚Äî roughly 40‚Äì60 min race power. |
| **W‚Ä≤** | Anaerobic work capacity (in kJ) ‚Äî energy you can expend above CP before exhaustion. |
| **Pace / km** | Equivalent running pace for the detected segment. |

### üß© 6Ô∏è‚É£ Best Practices & Progression Tracking

**Combining 5 K and 3/12 Tests**

A single 5 K test gives you a **range** of possible CP values.  
When you later perform a structured 3/12-minute test, it often helps to **validate or refine** that earlier estimate:

- If your new 3/12 test CP matches or exceeds the *upper end* of your previous 5 K range ‚Üí you‚Äôve likely improved ‚Äî adopt that higher CP.  
- If it falls closer to the *lower end* ‚Üí keep the conservative value until your next time trial confirms the trend.  
- Each method complements the other: the 5 K captures **race fitness**, the 3/12 test captures **physiological capacity**.

This balanced approach helps you avoid over-estimating CP while still tracking real improvements as they happen.
